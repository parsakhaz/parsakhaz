I'm Parsa. UW Informatics '23, Georgia Tech CS '25.

I love building things & `leveraging tech to generate value`. This means building web apps, workflows, scripts, systems, processes... whatever.

I hyper focus on finding `the 20% of effort` that generates `80% of the results`.

I am currently helping with all things Customer Discovery, SDR/BDR, and managing development of our front facing website for the [Allen Institute for Artifical Intelligence's Startup Incubator](https://www.ai2incubator.com/).
