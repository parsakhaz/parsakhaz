I'm Parsa. UW Informatics '23, Georgia Tech CS '25.

I love building things & `leveraging tech to generate value`. This means building web apps, workflows, scripts, systems, processes... whatever. My hackiest and in my opinion most interesting projects are private ;)

I hyper focus on finding `the 20% of effort` that generates `80% of the results`. Pareto's Principle. also a believer in Parkinson's law, "that work expands to fill the time allotted for its completion". as such, I give myself unreasonable deadlines, for unreasonable outcomes, and have gotten pretty decent at achieving them as times passed. I call this, "naive optimism", while others call it "procrastination"...

I am currently helping with all things AI, Business Development, Customer Discovery, SDR/BDR, Ops, and managing development of our front facing website for the [Allen Institute for Artifical Intelligence's Startup Incubator](https://www.ai2incubator.com/).
